        When I first heard about Windows containers, I got really excited by the idea of packaging ASP.Net legacy apps and ASP.Net Core apps consistently, without the need to remote into a VM and apply extra libraries. I soon found that Windows containers were quickly followed by a “yeah, but”. Windows node

        Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform and has been described as “the OS of the cloud”. It builds on container-based services by providing many features such as volumes for stateful services, resilience and scaling, monitoring, automated zero-downtime upgrades. It runs on a cluster of node

        Most cloud providers provide a managed Kubernetes cluster at this point. Each time I come back to look at Kubernetes, I feel like I’ve forgotten something (or everything). This post is a cheat sheet for getting a cluster up and running on Azure (using AKS) with recommended extras.

        “Serverless” was one of those terms that left me scratching my head when I first heard it. How on earth do you run a server… without a server??? That’s some crazy marketing spin! What I quickly learned is that serverless is referring to how much infrastructure you need to manage. That is, none. Nada

        I went to a great talk by Troy Hunt in Brisbane a while ago. Well, it was great at the time. It didn’t take long before I started to realise that most of the struggles I’ve had with HTTPS my blog could have actually been side stepped quite nicely by using Cloudflare.

        It was surprisingly easy to migrate my blog out of ghost, but there were a few missed steps along the way. Often, I would find a better way after I had done the heavy lifting.

1. Install Hexo and create the blog
$ npm install hexo-cli -g
$ hexo init myblog
$ cd myblog

        Let me start this by saying I’m loving my ghost blog, and I get a kick out of running it on AKS. The thing is, the content only changes when I post and so I’m thinking about caching and I realise the whole blog can be cached. It’s not an API. I don’t have changing data. (Ok, TECHNICALLY I have a db,

        I keep hitting the same problem when building Angular applications. Environment settings! They are easy to set up in development, but as you target different environments, the old “one file per environment” really doesn’t cut it. I don’t want to rebuild my application just to deploy to production an

        This post starts with a slight regret that I didn’t get Ghost running on a Web App. One of the brilliant parts of a Web App is that you can force all requests over HTTPS with the click of a button. Of course, I’d still need to organise a certificate for my domain. Hold on, let me stop and back up a

        In my previous post, I was looking into a few options for running my blog. I think at this time, I’m going to keep it on Azure because I can run it for free. I suspect I would make a different choice if not for my bonus credits. I will need some benchmark figures to choose a provider, however kubern

        There seems to come a time in a software developer’s life where you look at creating a blog. It’s that time for me. I want a place where I can write up some of my experiments for later reference, and if that can help others along the way, all the better!
